This contains VHDL source code that takes integer values and converts them to IEEE754 numbers.  It is fully pipelined and it uses an AXI-stream bus interface. For this first version, there is no support for special values like +/-0, NaN, etc. It also does not currently support fractional value inputs. The next revision will support the special values and it will support fractional input values.
