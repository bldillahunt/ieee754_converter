This contains VHDL source code that takes integer values and converts them to IEEE754 numbers.  It is fully pipelined and it uses an AXI-stream bus interface. For this first version, there is no support for special values like +/-0, NaN, etc. The next revision will support these special values.  The data on the AXIS bus can be configured to have an integer part and a fractional part. The number of bits in each of these is passed into the module using generics.
